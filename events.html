<h2>Book vs. Movie Storytellingâ€“ Divergent</h2>
  <p>For this event, members of the Language & Literature Club explored the popular novel Divergent by Veronica Roth. Students first read the book and then watched the movie adaptation at school. Afterward, they were challenged to write essays comparing the two versions, analyzing which medium told the story more effectively and why. The activity encouraged critical thinking, literary analysis, and clear written expression, while also sparking lively discussions about the differences between books and films.</p>
